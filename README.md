# US-COVID-19-vaccination
Repo for analyses for "Impact of vaccination on the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from U.S. states".

There are two parts in our anlaysis: (1) reduced-form analysis, and (2) structural analysis using SIR model. We put the STATA code for reduced-form analysis under "code/reduced_form" and the Matlab code the structural analysis under "code/SIR". Within each folder, we provide a readme file explaining the code.

Our put most of the data used in the analysis under the data folder. However, some data are deemed to big to share directly. In that case, we provide the link the code to download the data.
